## Overview

Speech impairment is a disability which affects an individuals ability to communicate using speech and hearing. Although sign language is ubiquitous in recent times, there remains a challenge for non-sign language speakers to communicate with sign language speakers or signers. With recent advances in deep learning and computer vision there has been promising progress in the fields of motion and gesture recognition using deep learning and computer vision based techniques. The focus of this work is to create a vision-based application that offers sign language translation to text thus aiding communication between signers and non-signers.
  - Machine Learning :
  - Android : Design UI/UX of the App, Connect project to firebase,Implement ML model with tflite file from firebase ML, Create Mini Dictionary (A-Z) with sample image from firebase, Create Help Explanation Page
  - Cloud: Made a project in google cloud platform, manage IAM roles, creating alerting for billing, then connect the GCP project in firebase, upload the ML model in machine learning (custom), create a bucket with firestore, create business / go-to market proposal.
